//! Issue rubash#761 — an unbounded external producer feeding a **shell-side**
//! tail never returns: the shell drains the producer into memory instead of
//! closing the read end and letting it die of SIGPIPE.
//!
//! GNU bash: `yes | true` returns in ~0.2 s with status 0 (`true` exits, the
//! pipe closes, `yes` gets SIGPIPE on its next write).  rubash: no output, no
//! diagnostic, no exit — the shell's RSS grows ~250 MB/s, reaching ~1 GB in
//! seconds, because the producer is materialised rather than bounded.
//!
//! The trigger is *not* "how many externals": `yes | head -1` is fine (the tail
//! is the process that exits) and `yes | cat | true` hangs too.  The
//! discriminator is whether some stage bounds the producer.
//!
//! Every test here is bounded on purpose.  A hang test that is not bounded turns
//! a red CI into a stuck CI, and a red run that does not kill the tree leaves a
//! `yes` behind to be inherited by the next test.  On expiry the whole process
//! tree is killed with `taskkill /T` and the test fails with the bound it hit.
